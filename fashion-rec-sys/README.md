# CMPE256-Fashion_Recommendation_System

It is a challenging task to develop a fashion suggestion system due to its subjectivity and complexity. While collaborative filtering and content-based filtering are quite popular in conventional recommendation systems, they are quite ineffective in the fashion industry. Considering that the visual signals are a key feature in fashion analysis, we aim to develop a fashion recommendation system based on product, and the overall outfit using vision-based models, primarily based on Spotify's Annoy.
